## Maximum Contiguos Subsequence Sum
 Question: A sub-array has one number of some continuous numbers. Given an integer array with positive numbers and negative numbers, get the maximum sum of all sub-arrays. Time complexity should be O(n).

For example, in the array {1, -2, 3, 10, -4, 7, 2, -5}, its sub-array {3, 10, -4, 7, 2} has the maximum sum 18.
